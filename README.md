## Showcase
Project showcases modular use of components (e.g IconButton) along with non-modular use of components that are directly imported from React Native(e.g TextInput).

## Notes 
Project has not been created on a Apple commputer hence testing on IOS has not been done. However, due to the project simplicity in nature a simple cd podinstall should be enough to get it up and running
